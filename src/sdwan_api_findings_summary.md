# SD-WAN API Findings Summary

## Key Insights from the API Mapping Verification Report

### 1. The /dataservice Prefix
- **OpenAPI Spec**: Paths are listed without prefix (e.g., `/admin/user`)
- **Actual API**: All endpoints require `/dataservice` prefix (e.g., `/dataservice/admin/user`)
- **Our Implementation**: CORRECT - We use OpenAPI paths as-is, the SDK adds the prefix internally

### 2. Operation IDs vs SDK Methods
- **OpenAPI**: Uses specific operation IDs like `findUsers_1`, `createUser_1`
- **SDK**: Uses generic CRUD methods like `get()`, `create()`, `update()`, `delete()`
- **Our Implementation**: CORRECT - We map OpenAPI operation IDs to SDK methods

### 3. SDK Endpoint Structure
The report mentions SDK calls like `session.api.users.get()`, but our introspection found:
- `administration.users` for user operations
- `administration.user_groups` for user groups
- `administration_settings` for AAA config

This suggests either:
1. The SDK has multiple ways to access the same endpoints
2. The SDK structure has evolved between versions
3. Our introspection captures a different view than the direct API access

### 4. Known Issues Already Addressed
- **device_state endpoint**: Doesn't have a generic `get()` method
- **Solution**: We added special handling in the client to use `get_devices_health_details()` instead

## Validation of Our Approach

Our current implementation is fundamentally correct:
1. ✅ We use OpenAPI paths without the `/dataservice` prefix
2. ✅ We map OpenAPI operation IDs to SDK method names
3. ✅ We handle special cases where SDK methods don't match the pattern
4. ✅ We serialize SD-WAN specific objects properly

## Remaining Questions

1. **SDK Version**: The report mentions the SDK moved from `cisco-open/cisco-catalyst-wan-sdk` to `cisco-en-programmability/catalystwan-sdk`. We should verify we're using the latest version.

2. **Endpoint Access Patterns**: The discrepancy between `session.api.users` vs `administration.users` needs investigation. Both might be valid.

## Recommendations

1. **Keep current mappings**: They work with the SDK we're using
2. **Document SDK version**: Ensure we're using the latest catalystwan SDK
3. **Add fallback logic**: If `administration.users` fails, try `users` directly
4. **Test with real instance**: The best validation would be testing against an actual SD-WAN Manager instance
