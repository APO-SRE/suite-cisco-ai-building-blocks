The **Domain Samples** archive lets the Cisco AI Building Blocks **AI Agent**
answer *high‑fidelity, industry‑specific* questions. Every subfolder under
`domain_samples/` represents a separate **domain**. Each folder contains 
one‑or‑more JSON files that mimic private, internal data you might want 
to keep out of the public model context but *in* your 
Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow.

*Example*: `domain_samples/healthcare/appointments.json` – a synthetic
Electronic Medical Record slice that you would **never** send to the LLM
unfiltered. Instead, you vector‑index it and let the agent retrieve only the
relevant paragraphs.

## 1  What’s in a Domain folder?

```
domain_samples/
 └─ healthcare/
    ├─ appointments.json
    ├─ lab_tests.json
    └─ policy_docs.json
```

* Mix as many JSON files as you want – the indexing script treats each top‑level
  key as an individual document chunk.
* Geospatial or aggregation views go in **…\_locations.json** or
  **…\_aggregate.json** files; the agent can then reason about addresses,
  clusters, etc.

## 3  Sample prompts & answers

Each domain section provides 10 exemplar **prompt → answer → follow‑up** triples
so you can copy‑paste into ChatGPT or the included HTML front end to see what
RAG feels like with private data.

> **Tip:** When you set `DOMAIN_SAMPLES_INDEX_FOLDER_NAME=healthcare` the agent
> automatically loads only *Healthcare* keywords and vectors – drastically
> speeding up retrieval and reducing hallucinations.


Additionally, many LOBs have **location** or **aggregate** JSON files (e.g., `farm_locations.json`, `airport_locations.json`, `manufacturing_sites.json`). These are indexed too, enabling the AI to answer more in-depth queries (like *addresses*, *relation to other objects*, etc.) and demonstrate **connectedness** across multiple records.
